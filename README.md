# Andrey Estevam Seabra
Computer Science, Mathematics, Data Science and Statistics student at the University of Richmond (GPA: 3.89). Selected as a [Richmond Scholar](https://scholars.richmond.edu/), one of 25 recipients selected from +12,500 applicants for the university's most prestigious merit award (full-ride, covering full tuition, housing, and food).
My work spans robotics systems, full-stack development, and applied machine learning. I'm drawn to problems that require both theoretical rigor and clean, production-ready implementation. Highly interested and curious about turning creative ideas/solutions to real-world problems into computational problems.

# Honors
- Richmond Scholar (Full-Ride; 11,500+ applicants)
- International STEM Medalist (High School; World's Top 3 Medalist, first Latin American in a major STEM olympiad)
- Dean’s List
- All-A’s List
- Metcalf Prize (5 sophomores awarded)
- Omicron Delta Kappa (Top 5%)

# Some of my experience
Software Engineer, Human and Intelligent Vehicle Ensemble Lab (Aug 2025 – Present)
- Designed and implemented a revamped application to manage 10+ robot location sensors, replacing a legacy Android/Java system and improving reliability for dozens of users
- Built a cross-platform Bluetooth management layer in Python by analyzing existing Java Bluetooth code, expanding an Android-only system to support macOS, Windows, and Linux
- Developed concurrent software using Python Async and multithreading to handle multiple processes, threads, and tasks, enabling real-time visualization of sensor location data

Research Engineer, Human and Intelligent Vehicle Ensemble Lab (May 2024 – Present)
- Engineered an estimation algorithm for DWM sensor data that increased prediction precision and reduced latency through iterative testing to improve robots' real-time autonomous decision-making
- Implemented an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for a nonlinear model and automated data-processing pipelines, reducing estimation error from 7.5 cm to 1.6 cm for a 78% improvement while boosting efficiency, and reliability in a high-noise indoor positioning system
- Designed and developed the estimation algorithm as a ROS2 node, gaining experience with concurrent ROS2 nodes and real-time communication in distributed robotic systems
